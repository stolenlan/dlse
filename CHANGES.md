### Version 1.0.0
+ Starting at version 1 because, it's working as a cli tool that a Windows
  user can simply double click on, and enter interactive mode.
+ It's not complicated, so I made sure to comment as little as possible to keep
  things fun.

### Version 1.0.1
+ Realized that my bitcoin donation address was missing a character at the end,
  phew, that was close, I almost lost out on the potential gold mine.
