### Version 1.0.0
+ Starting at version 1 because, it's working as a cli tool that a Windows
  user can simply double click on, and enter interactive mode.
+ It's not complicated, so I made sure to comment as little as possible to keep
  things fun.

### Version 1.0.1
+ Realized that my bitcoin donation address was missing a character at the end,
  phew, that was close, I almost lost out on the potential gold mine.

### Version 1.0.2
+ Updated the README.md (It was late, and the wording was a bit strong).
+ Added the item binary to .gitignore
+ Updated the interactive mode help
+ Made a few tweaks to dlse.c
+ Added a few comments to dlse.h/c main.c (for me not you)
+ Cleaned up some whitespace etc. to make things a bit easier to read.
+ Deleted dev/windows-example.c
